Session 0 notes:

- This course does not use a TDD approach, but it does show good test-as-you-go practices.

- Let’s Start Coding

Session 2 notes:

- I think it is best to have the test folder structure mirror the lib structure. Instead of having a file called impl_game_test.exs, I think it would be better to have an impl directory under /test, which would leave us with test/impl/game_test.exs
- Perhaps discuss the rant about cyclomatic complexity at the end of Let’s Start Coding / Pattern Matching Game State
- I like the reminder of the Single Responsibility Principle, maybe I should drive that idea home. (and maybe SOLID in general)
- Once at the end of this session’s content, take note of how little Dave uses anonymous functions. While anonymous functions are convenient and are nifty to use, named functions are actually better for readability (especially when the contents of the anonymous function are large…more than a few lines).
